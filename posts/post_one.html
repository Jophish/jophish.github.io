<p>Just kidding. I have no idea what I'm doing. I've wanted a <strong>website</strong> for a long time, but didn't want to make a shitty one. Long story short, I'm in Grenoble, France for the summer and I speak next to no French despite "learning" the language for six years, so I figured there's no better time than now to do some stuff I've been meaning to do - like making a website. I don't think it looks <em>that</em> bad.</p>
<p>It's super shoddily thrown together though. I started trying to learn Ruby on Rails (which is probably still a good idea) but got somewhat fed up when I realized that the overhead involved is way more than what's necessary to make something as simple as this site. I ended up going with some Python and Mustache for templating + Bootstrap to make it responsive. The code is all on my Github <a href="https://github.com/Jophish/jophish.github.io">here</a>. Like I said, I still have no idea what I'm doing. Probably don't look at the site on mobile, some of the responsive bits are still kind of messed up. (Mainly some font size stuff on window resize + the sidebar kind of disappears instead of getting stacked on top of the rest of the site - if someone wants to help me, please.) But hey, the post titles do this cool CSS thing when you hover over them. That's neat, right?</p>
<p>Anyways, the whole point of this site is to give me a place where I can put cool things that I make - thus also giving me more of a reason to make cool things. Also for <strong>blogging</strong>. I'm a <strong>blogger</strong> now too. Wow.</p>
<p>Also, I've incedentally been spending a lot of time customizing my Debian install lately - maybe I'll write more about it later. (It's Debian running <a href="http://herbstluftwm.org/">herbstufltwm</a> as its window manager, with a ton of really nice customizations &amp; scripts on top of it. Also if you've never heard of herbstluft before, I really recommend you check it out. It's a really lovely and tiny manual tiling window manager which allows for an absurd amount of customization on top). I used <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a> as my editor of choice for a long time but always told myself I'd one day really learn either <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> or <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>, and I finally got around to emacs, and man, is it great. </p>

Doesn't that look nice? It's a better IDE than anything I've ever used for any language (except maybe with Java - as much as I hate Eclipse, it does offer some benefits that Emacs really cannot,) and it's actually made my working not only more efficient, but more enjoyable as well. Anyways, that's all I have. I'd like to try to post on here often, given my overwhelming lack of motivation doesn't kick in. Also, if you're looking for some stuff to listen to, try these.
